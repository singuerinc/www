# I'm Nahuel Scotti. This is my personal website.

I started my training early in the world of creativity, at age 20, combining Graphic Design studies with endless hours to an agency in Argentina, getting to know the hardest advertising.

In 2004, in search of new opportunities, I travelled to Italy, where I worked in Studio Leonardo and I learnt what HTML and Javascript are. In 2008, I was hired in DoubleYou as Flash developer. I had the opportunity to work with very capable people, from which I learnt a lot.

In 2013, after five years in DoubleYou I changed to an international top production company, <a href="https://www.b-reel.com/" target="_blank">B-REEL</a>, where I worked as a Senior Developer with some of the most creative people around the World.

In 2016 I moved to Stockholm, Sweden. Iâ€™m working in the Game Framework Team at <a href="https://www.netent.com/en/" target="_blank">NetEnt</a>, a premium supplier of digitally distributed gaming systems.

<br />

I make apps in HTML5, Javascript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails among others technologies.
