<p class="text hide">I started my training early in the world of creativity, at age 20, combining Graphic Design studies with endless hours to an agency in Argentina, getting to know the hardest advertising.</p>
<p class="text hide">In 2004, in search of new opportunities, I travelled to Italy, where I worked in Studio Leonardo and I learnt what HTML and Javascript are. In 2008, I was hired in DoubleYou as Flash developer. I had the opportunity to work with very capable people, from which I learnt a lot.</p>
