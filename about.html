<p class="text hide">I started my training early in the world of creativity, at age 20, combining Graphic Design studies with endless hours to an agency in Argentina, getting to know the hardest advertising.</p>

<p class="text hide">In 2004, in search of new opportunities, I travelled to Italy, where I worked in Studio Leonardo and I learnt what HTML and Javascript are. In 2008, I was hired in DoubleYou as Flash developer. I had the opportunity to work with very capable people, from which I learnt a lot.</p>

<p class="text hide">In 2013, after five years in DoubleYou I changed to an international top production company, <a href="https://www.b-reel.com/" target="_blank">B-REEL</a>, where I worked as a Senior Developer with some of the most creative people around the World.</p>

<p class="text hide">In 2016 I moved to Stockholm, Sweden. I’m working in the Game Framework Team at <a href="https://www.netent.com/en/" target="_blank">NetEnt</a>, a premium supplier of digitally distributed gaming systems.</p>

<p class="text hide">I make apps in HTML5, Javascript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails among others technologies.</p>
