Working at Doubleyou, Pepe Jeans asked us to redesign and develop their ~~new~~ old e-commerce frontend.

We developed a dynamic frontend with Java/Magnolia. All the layout was customizable throught the Magnolia UI using custom components.

At that time, HTML5 was the new guy in the town, so we built the entire website with open technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and a JavaScript/Backbone application to make it more reactive.

Fully responsive, mobile first, the website featured a 12-grid-based layout based on Bootstrap.
