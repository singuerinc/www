Overlay is an open source application I have developed. In the beginning it was just for fun, but rapidly it became a main tool in my daily workflow.

It functionality is quiet basic but powerful. Like an onion paper, Overlay displays an image over any application.

The main purpose of Overlay is to help the user with a guide, making simple to achieve a pixel perfect design.

Initially I develop it in ActionScript, but I have ported it to Electron (Javascript+React).
