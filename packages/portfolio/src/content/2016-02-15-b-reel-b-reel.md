Working at B-REEL, the company decided to update the whole website, making it fully responsive and with a new design.

Together with the team, we were responsible for making both frontend and backend, deciding the architecture to use, and selecting the technology to make it.

The frontend features a fully responsive bootstrap 12-grid layout and a custom Marionette/Backbone application to make smooth transitions and interactions on each page.

I was also one of the core contributors of the B-REEL Javascript Framework, an innersource project which b-reel.com makes use of it.
