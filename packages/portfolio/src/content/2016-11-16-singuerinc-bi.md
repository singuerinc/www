Bi. Your Instagramâ„¢ feed, but bigger!

[https://bi.singuerinc.com](https://bi.singuerinc.com)

Bi is a personal experiment. Is a website that displays images from your Instagram feed but with higher resolution and size.

The idea behind it was to test technologies like Vue.js, webpack, Docker, PostCSS and yarn among others.
