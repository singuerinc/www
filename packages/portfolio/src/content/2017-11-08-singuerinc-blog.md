After some years using Ruby/Jekyll to build my blog I decided to migrate it to Node/React/Gatsby.

I [wrote a blog](https://blog.singuerinc.com/jekyll/gatsby/graphql/2017/11/01/migrate-from-jekyll-to-gatsby/) post describing how I migrated it.

[Kyle Mathews](https://github.com/KyleAMathews) (Creator/Founder @ GatsbyJS) liked so much my post that he asked me to re-post it in the official Gatsby blog:
