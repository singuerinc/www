Facebook asked to B-Reel to create a landing page for they new mobile application. I have been in charge of create the front-end page and making things move.<br/><br/>It was funny to create a responsive single-page site with kind of paralax. Was a great challenge to create the video open animation that works across different devices, in fact some time after I was so proud of see Codedrops creating a tutorial based on that effect: <a href='http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/09/17/how-to-create-a-fullscreen-video-opening-animation/' target='_blank'>http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/09/17/how-to-create-a-fullscreen-video-opening-animation/</a>
