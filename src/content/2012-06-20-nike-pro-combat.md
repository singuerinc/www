Nike Pro Combat is a t-shirt that protects you against cold.

Based on that we created a digital battle between two teams: Andres Iniesta's team and Cristiano Ronaldo's team.

The application offered a serie of websites to attack and defend.

As a user I could select a website and attack. But... if the opponent was protecting it, then Iniesta or Cristiano appeared dressing the t-shirt.

Those websites were basically affiliates to an ad campaing.
To show those players we used a Flash application embeded in a interstitial banner.
