In collaboration with my friends Antonio and Ilaria we developed this webpage for a local kindergarten.

Colored design and photography, smooth transitions and animations. This single-page website is all about give an overview of a fresh environment for the little ones.

Since the client give us total freedom we tried a bunch of different technologies on it.
We end up using CoffeeScript as, at that time, was the most fancy way of writing Javascript.
