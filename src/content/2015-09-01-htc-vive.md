I was involved in the beginning of this project, mainly because I have experience with Docker and concurrency.

One of the main challenges of this experiment was to server the application to a high number of user simultaneously.

To achieve that, we set up a scalable solution that is running on several Google Compute Engine instances around the world.

We used Docker to deploy, deliver fast, and continuously.

The project made use of the WebSocket technology which enables the user to use a phone to control the game on a computer.
