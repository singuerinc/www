_"Zalando partnered with B-Reel to launch IVY PARK, the new and highly anticipated collection from Beyoncé. We created a responsive experience to captivate a community craving IVY PARK content, by presenting it in preloaded full-screen video on mobile and desktop._
<br/><br/>
_IVY PARK is inspired by Beyoncé’s childhood running spot; a park where she gained the strength to succeed. That park became a state of mind. The campaign challenges Europe to join the #MYPARK movement by sharing their park on social media._
<br/><br/>
_Key European influencers across 11 markets shared their park and story, inspiring the community to tell their friends what #MYPARK means to them._
<br/><br/>
_We also created a simple tool to create a personalised campaign badge. Simply upload your own ‘park’ photo, select a custom IVY PARK filter to turn your photo into a #MYPARK badge and share it with your friends and followers._
<br/><br/>
_The IVY PARK collection section features looks from Beyoncé’s new TV commercial, and Zalando looks. A clean architecture ensures easy navigation by simply toggling between the collection and social space at any time._
<br/><br/>
_The entire campaign activates a community that eagerly awaited the launch of this exciting new label. As a result, IVY PARK content and stories are flooding social media." \*_
