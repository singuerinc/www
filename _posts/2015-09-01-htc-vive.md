I was involved in the beginning of this project, mainly because I have experience with Docker and concurrency.

One of the main challenges of this experiment was to server the application to a high number of user simultaneously.

To achieve that we set up a scalable solution that was running on several Google Compute Engine instances around the world. We used Docker to deploy, deliver fast, and continuously.

The project made use of the WebSocket technology which enable the users to use their phones to control the game on their computers.
