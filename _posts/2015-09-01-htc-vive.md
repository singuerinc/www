_"In 2016, HTC is poised to redefine VR, with the launch of the Vive. The state-of-the-art VR headset ships with two wireless controllers, and room-scale motion tracking - enabling a world first virtual reality gaming experience controlled by body movement. We created a launch campaign that blurs the line between real and virtual, with movement at its heart._
<br/><br/>
_To give gamers a taste of the real thing, we created a browser based 3D game, controlled by swinging, slashing and waving your paired mobile device. The crazier the movement the better.<br/>The challenge is to complete the game and prove you’re ‘Vive Ready’._
<br/><br/>
_We seeded the Vive concept on YouTube by turning classic gaming genres into eight real life street stunt films. Each set-up sprang an amusing physical game scenario onto unsuspecting members of the public for an on-the-spot ‘Vive Ready’ test. YouTube viewers were then invited to play the game and take their own test." \*_
