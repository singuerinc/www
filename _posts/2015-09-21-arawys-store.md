Arawys was my first project in Prestashop. It was a good experience to understand how this open-source e-commerce works and how can you change entirely based on your needs.<br/>I was in charge of doing all the front and backend stuff for this website. It was a nice challenge to deal with all those payments methods! I have also setup all environments, servers, databases, backups.
