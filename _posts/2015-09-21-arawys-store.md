It was the perfect excuse to explore the world of e-Commerces. After test several options I decided to give a try to Prestashop.

I selected it for many reasons:

- Because is open-source and it has a big community behind, it means good support.
- Is written in PHP and has a very easy setup, also runs well on Docker.
- The client had a tight budget and PS is free.

It was a really nice experience to learn how this open source project works and how is it possible to change it entirely based on your needs.

This was one of those project that you are in charge of everything. From setting up the environments to automate the prepare the images for the frontend.
