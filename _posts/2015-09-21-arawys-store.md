_Arawys is a new way of selling clothes for the woman in Per&uacute;. It combines the latest tendencies from Europe with the fresh and energy from South America._
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Arawys was my first project in Prestashop. It was a really nice experience to learn how this (open source) e-commerce works and how could you change it entirely based on your needs.
<br/><br/>
I was in charge of doing all the front and backend for this website, combining HTML, CSS3, Javascript and PHP. It was a nice challenge to deal with all those payments methods! I have also set up all environments, servers, deploys, databases and backups.
