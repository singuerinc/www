I was working at B-REEL when Facebook asked them to create a landing page for their new mobile application "Moments".  

I had fun creating this fully responsive single-page site, which has a kind of parallax effect.

Actually, it was a great challenge to me to create the video's open animation and make it works across all different devices. In fact some time after the release I was surprised when Codrops created a tutorial based on this effect:
