I was working at B-REEL when Facebook asked them to create a landing page for their new mobile application "Moments".  

I had a great time creating this fully responsive single-page site.  
If you click on the "Watch the video" button you will see a cool video transition made with a mix of CSS and Javascript. And when you scroll the page shows a fancy parallax effect.

About the video transition:  
It was a great challenge to me to make transition works across all kind of devices.  
In fact, some time after the release, I was surprised when Codrops creates <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/09/17/how-to-create-a-fullscreen-video-opening-animation/" target="_blank">a tutorial based on such effect</a>.
