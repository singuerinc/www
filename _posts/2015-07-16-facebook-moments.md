Facebook asked to B-Reel to create a landing page for they new mobile application. I was in charge of create a this website and making things move.  

It was funny to create a fully responsive single-page site with a kind of parallax effect. Actually, it was a great challenge to create the video open animation working across different devices. In fact some time after the release I was surprised seeing Codrops creating a tutorial based on this effect:
