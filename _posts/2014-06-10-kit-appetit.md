**Kit Appétit** is not about technology. In fact, is the most simple website I have ever made.  
Is about the process of making it and the need for adaptation to the surrounding environment.

My wife had the great idea of create beautiful kits for sell as a present.  
Not a simple box, just the opposite. Each kit should be special.  

Since we had just a few dollars to build it, almost everything was made by us, with help from friends and family.

During its lifetime it has adapted to all kind of changes:

- At the beginning we made the website with Ruby on Rails, and Spree, an open source e-commerce. 
- After a while, since the payment solution was too complicated to mantain we created a custom theme on Big Cartel, bad idea.
- We did't sold as much as we would so we changed our website to a Ruby/Sinatra app on a free OpenShift gear.
- Now, for the sake of simplicity we are building the site in GitLab CI and deploying it on GitLab Pages, yay!

Nowadays **Kit Appétit** is almost inactive since we do not have time to invest on it, but it will still evolving as much as the environment changes in order to keep it alive.
