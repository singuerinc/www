Working at B-REEL, the company decided to update the whole website, making it fully responsive and with a new the design.

Together with the team, we were responsible for making both frontend and backend, deciding the architecture to use and selecting the technology to make it.

The front end features a fully responsive bootstrap 12-grid layout and a custom Marionette/Backbone application to make smooth transitions and interactions on each page.

I was also one of the core contributors of the B-REEL Javascript Framework, an innersource project which b-reel.com makes use of it.
