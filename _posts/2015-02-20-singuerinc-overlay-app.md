Overlay is an open source application I have developed just for fun at the beginning but becames a main tool in my daily work.  

It functionality is quiet basic but powerful. Like an onion paper, Overlay displays an image over another application.

The main purpose of Overlay is to help the user with a guide, making simpler to achieve a pixel perfect design.

I developed it in AIR/ActionScript, but I'm thinking about porting it to Javascript.
