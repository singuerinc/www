Overlay is a open source application I developed some time ago. It functionality is quiet basic, but powerful: overlay an image over other application, like an onion paper.
<br/><br/>
It main purpose is to help the developer with a guide, making easy to achieve a pixel perfect app.
<br/><br/>
It was developed in AIR/ActionScript.
<br/>
My original idea was to develop it in HTML/CSS/JS, but at that time and currently is not possible to have a transparent window (without some ugly hacks). 
<br/><br/>
