excerpt: I seamlessly integrated PrestaShop for Arawys, an e-commerce platform in Peru, merging European fashion trends with the energetic essence of South America, delivering a unique online shopping experience for women.

Arawys was the perfect excuse to explore the world of e-commerce.
After testing several options I decided to give a try to PrestaShop.

I end up selecting it for many reasons:

- It is open source and it has a big community behind, which means good support in case of troubles.
- It is written in PHP and it is easy to setup. Also, it runs well on Docker.
- I choose it also because it is possible to change it entirely based on your needs.
- And because the client had a tight budget and PrestaShop is free to use.

It was one of those project that I was in charge of everything: frontend, backend, sysadmin, and also making changes to the design.

_"Arawys is a new way of selling clothes for the woman in Per&uacute;. It combines the latest tendencies from Europe with the fresh and energy from South America"._
