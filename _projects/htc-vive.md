excerpt: Leveraging my expertise in Docker and concurrency, I contributed to a project aimed at serving the application to a large number of users simultaneously. Confronted with the challenge of scalability, we implemented a solution utilizing multiple Google Compute Engine instances worldwide. Docker facilitated the efficient deployment and continuous delivery of the project. Notably, the use of WebSockets enabled users to control the game on their computer using their phone, enhancing the interactive experience.

I was involved in this project due to the fact that I have some experience with Docker and concurrency.

One of the main challenges of this experiment was to serve the application to a high number of user simultaneously.

To achieve that, we set up a scalable solution that is running on several Google Compute Engine instances around the world.

We used Docker to deploy, deliver continuously and fast.

The project uses WebSocket which allows the user to use a phone to control the game on a computer.
