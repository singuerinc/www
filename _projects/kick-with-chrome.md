Do a **Chrome Experiment** is one of those things that every developer want to do.

I had the chance of doing it and I could say that is both exciting and challenging.

During the development the Google's team was continuously reviewing the code, giving us feedback, ensuring that we were doing both secure and high quality code.

**Kick with Chrome** is all about using your phone to control your game.
Behind the scenes the technology used is WebSockets and WebRTC.

As a requirement we used the **Google Closure Library**, the same Javascript framework that powers Gmail and Google's Maps.

To serve the games to entire World we made use of Google's infrastructure, Google App Engine and Google Compute Engine.

For the frontend, the common standards: HTML5, Javascript and CSS3.
In the backend, we created a cluster of Node.js applications.

Check out the video to get an idea of what I'm talking about:
