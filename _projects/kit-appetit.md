excerpt: Kit Appétit is not about technology but the process of creation and adaptation. It began with the idea of crafting unique gift kits on a limited budget. We started with Ruby on Rails and Spree, then switched to a custom theme on Big Cartel, and later to a Ruby/Sinatra app on OpenShift. Migrating to GitLab CI and Pages followed, and now it resides on Netlify for simplicity. Although currently inactive, Kit Appétit will continue evolving to adapt to its environment and stay alive.

**Kit Appétit** is not about technology. In fact, is the most simple website I have ever built.
Is about the process of crafting it and the need for adaptation to the surrounding environment.

My wife had the great idea of create beautiful kits to sell as a present.
Not a simple box, the opposite. Each kit is be special.

Since we had just a few dollars to build it, everything was made by us, with the help from friends and family.

During its lifetime it has adapted to all kind of changes:

- At the beginning we made the website with Ruby on Rails, and Spree, an open source e-commerce.
- After a while, since the payment solution was too complicated to maintain we created a custom theme on Big Cartel, bad idea.
- We did't sold as much as we would so we changed our website to a Ruby/Sinatra app on a free OpenShift gear.
- A bit more of a year ago I migrated the site to build on GitLab CI and deploying it on GitLab Pages.
- Now, for the sake of simplicity we build and deploy it on Netlify, yay!

Nowadays **Kit Appétit** is almost inactive since we do not have time to invest on it, but it will still evolving as much as the environment changes in order to keep it alive.
