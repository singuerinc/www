excerpt: In collaboration with Nike, we developed a compelling app for FC Barcelona fans to unite under "we are one." Using Flash and Papervision, we created interactive 3D t-shirts. Over 172,000 t-shirts were generated and shared in hours, reaching around 280,000 in days. This project engaged fans and fostered unity among FC Barcelona supporters globally.

I am a big fan of Boca Juniors, but since I was living in Barcelona for almost 10 years I could say that I feel something when I see a FC Barcelona match.

Together with Nike we built this small application where the fans of FCB could manifest the statement: "we are one".

The result was a complete success: 172.000 t-shirts were created and shared in few hours, about 280.000 in a couple of days.

The application was built in Flash and Papervision was used to create the t-shirt in 3D.
