I am a big fan of Boca Juniors, but since I was living in Barcelona for almost 10 years I could say that I feel something when I see a FC Barcelona match.

Together with Nike we built this small application where the fans of FCB could manifest the statement: "we are one".

The result was a complete success: 172.000 t-shirts were created and shared in few hours, about 280.000 in a couple of days.

The application was built in Flash and Papervision was used to create the t-shirt in 3D.
