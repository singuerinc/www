excerpt: In collaboration with Nike, we developed a compelling application for FC Barcelona fans to unite under the statement "we are one." Using Flash technology, we leveraged Papervision to create interactive 3D t-shirts. The response was remarkable, with over 172,000 t-shirts generated and shared within a few hours, and an impressive total of around 280,000 within a couple of days. This project successfully engaged fans and fostered a sense of unity among FC Barcelona supporters worldwide.

I am a big fan of Boca Juniors, but since I was living in Barcelona for almost 10 years I could say that I feel something when I see a FC Barcelona match.

Together with Nike we built this small application where the fans of FCB could manifest the statement: "we are one".

The result was a complete success: 172.000 t-shirts were created and shared in few hours, about 280.000 in a couple of days.

The application was built in Flash and Papervision was used to create the t-shirt in 3D.
