excerpt: 'At Diet Doctor, I worked on enhancing the website by developing features such as the Meal Planner and Shopping List. We migrated critical pages to a new stack using Gatsby, React, and Typescript. Additionally, I focused on optimizing website performance and monitoring core web vitals for a better user experience.

As a manager at Diet Doctor, I led two teams, the Mobile and Frontend teams, with a total of ten direct reports (over two years). I was responsible for overseeing their growth plans, providing mentoring and coaching support, and ensuring their professional development.'
