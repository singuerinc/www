In this website I was focused mainly on the backend.

On the frontend, the section "My Park" takes the data from several statics json files.

I developed a Node.js application that communicates frequently with an external API.

This API collects data from different social media sources, such as Instagram and Facebook.
Once the data is fetched, the program updates the json files with the new data and serves the latest documents to the client.
