excerpt: In partnership with Beyonce, Zalando launches a website. I focused on backend development, while the frontend includes a "My Park" section that retrieves data from JSON files. I used Node.js to create an application that communicates with an external API gathering data from Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms. The program updates the JSON files with the latest information, dynamically serving them to the client.

In this website I was focused mainly on the backend.

On the frontend, the section "My Park" takes the data from several statics json files.

I developed a Node.js application that communicates frequently with an external API.

This API collects data from different social media sources, such as Instagram and Facebook.
Once the data is fetched, the program updates the json files with the new data and serves the latest documents to the client.
