excerpt: Overlay is an open source application that started as a fun project but soon became an essential tool in my daily workflow. It provides a simple yet powerful feature of overlaying images on any application, serving as a guide for achieving pixel-perfect designs. Originally developed in ActionScript, I later ported it to Electron, utilizing JavaScript and React.

Overlay is an open source application I have developed. In the beginning it was just for fun, but rapidly it became a main tool in my daily workflow.

It functionality is quiet basic but powerful. Like an onion paper, Overlay displays an image over any application.

The main purpose of Overlay is to help the user with a guide, making simple to achieve a pixel perfect design.

Initially I develop it in ActionScript, but I have ported it to Electron (Javascript+React).
