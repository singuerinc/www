excerpt: At B-REEL, we overhauled the company's website, ensuring full responsiveness and a fresh design. Our team handled frontend and backend development, making architectural decisions and technology selections. The frontend incorporated a responsive bootstrap 12-grid layout and a custom Marionette/Backbone application for seamless page transitions and interactions. Additionally, I played a key role as a core contributor to the B-REEL Javascript Framework, an innersource project utilized by b-reel.com.

Working at B-REEL, the company decided to update the whole website, making it fully responsive and with a new design.

Together with the team, we were responsible for making both frontend and backend, deciding the architecture to use, and selecting the technology to make it.

The frontend features a fully responsive bootstrap 12-grid layout and a custom Marionette/Backbone application to make smooth transitions and interactions on each page.

I was also one of the core contributors of the B-REEL Javascript Framework, an innersource project which b-reel.com makes use of it.
