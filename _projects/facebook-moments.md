excerpt: While at B-REEL, I had the pleasure of developing a fully responsive landing page for Facebook's mobile application, "Moments." This single-page site featured an engaging video transition animation created using a combination of CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, scrolling the page revealed a captivating parallax effect. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, crafting a visually appealing and interactive experience to introduce users to the innovative features of "Moments."

I was working at B-REEL when Facebook asked us to create a landing page for their new mobile application called "Moments".

I had a great time creating this fully responsive single-page site.

The page is quite simple, if you click on the "Watch the video" button you will see a cool video transition animation made with a mix of CSS and Javascript. By scrolling the page displays a fancy parallax effect.

About the video transition:

It was a great challenge to me to make the transition works across all kind of devices.
In fact, some time after the release, I was surprised when Codrops creates <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/09/17/how-to-create-a-fullscreen-video-opening-animation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tutorial based on such effect</a>.
