excerpt: We developed a digital battle featuring Nike Pro Combat, a cold-weather protective t-shirt. Users could choose to attack or defend websites affiliated with the ad campaign, with the teams led by Andres Iniesta and Cristiano Ronaldo. When an opponent successfully defended a website, Iniesta or Ronaldo would appear wearing the t-shirt. The battle was facilitated by a Flash application embedded in an interstitial banner, providing an engaging and interactive experience for users.

Nike Pro Combat is a t-shirt that protects you against the cold.

Based on that we created a digital battle between two teams: Andres Iniesta's team and Cristiano Ronaldo's team.

The application offered a serie of websites to attack and defend.

As a user I could select a website and attack. But... if the opponent was protecting it then Iniesta or Cristiano appeared dressing the t-shirt.

Those websites were basically affiliates to an ad campaign.
To show those players we used a Flash application embedded in a interstitial banner.
