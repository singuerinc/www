Audi "Driving Experience" was for many years my favorite project. It was where I learnt how to manage complex states within an application. It was my first "real" MVC application.

At that time GitHub was not there to pick one of the hundred options we have now. So I created my own MVC framework that allow me to manage view states with sophisticated animations.
