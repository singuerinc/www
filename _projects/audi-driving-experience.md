excerpt: The Audi "Driving Experience" project is my favorite endeavor. It taught me how to handle complex states within an application effectively. Since GitHub wasn't available at the time, I created my own MVC framework to manage view states, including intricate animations for a better user experience. It was a significant milestone as my first "real" MVC application, demonstrating my ability to handle sophisticated application architectures.

Audi "Driving Experience" was for many years my favorite project. It was where I learnt how to manage complex states within an application. It was my first "real" MVC application.

At that time GitHub was not there to pick one of the hundred options we have now. So I created my own MVC framework that allow me to manage view states with sophisticated animations.
