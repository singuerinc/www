excerpt: The Audi "Driving Experience" project holds a special place as my favorite endeavor. It served as a valuable learning experience, teaching me how to effectively handle complex states within an application. As GitHub wasn't available back then, I developed my own MVC framework to manage view states, incorporating intricate animations for enhanced user experience. This project marked a significant milestone as my first "real" MVC application, showcasing my ability to navigate and manage sophisticated application architectures.

Audi "Driving Experience" was for many years my favorite project. It was where I learnt how to manage complex states within an application. It was my first "real" MVC application.

At that time GitHub was not there to pick one of the hundred options we have now. So I created my own MVC framework that allow me to manage view states with sophisticated animations.
