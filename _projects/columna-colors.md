excerpt: From an ancient 2008 backup, I revived a website that displays 16.7 million spectrum digital colors. This project, crafted during my early days at DoubleYou, showcases one color every 1.8 seconds throughout an entire year. Despite its simplicity as a business card, it serves as a profound representation of a company's corporate identity, emphasizing the significance of color in branding and design.

I resurrected this website from a very old backup from 2008. It was one of my first project working at DoubleYou.

A site that shows for an entire year, one by one, 16.7 million spectrum digital color across something as simple as a business card, essential symbol of the corporate identity of a company.
