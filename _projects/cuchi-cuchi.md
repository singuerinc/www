excerpt: In collaboration with Antonio and Ilaria, we developed a colorful and engaging single-page website for a local kindergarten. Featuring smooth transitions, captivating photography, and animations, it provides a fresh environment overview for young children. With creative freedom, we explored different technologies and settled on using CoffeeScript, a stylish choice for writing JavaScript in 2012. The result is a visually appealing platform that highlights the kindergarten's inviting atmosphere.

In collaboration with my friends Antonio and Ilaria we developed this webpage for a local kindergarten.

Colored design and photography, smooth transitions and animations. This single-page website is all about give an overview of a fresh environment for the little ones.

Since the client gave us total freedom we tried a bunch of different technologies on it.
We end up using CoffeeScript, that in 2012 was the most fancy way of writing Javascript.
