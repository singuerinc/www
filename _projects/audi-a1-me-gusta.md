excerpt: We developed a web experience for Audi to showcase the customizable options of the A1 model. Users could visualize 850 car variants in a shared space, with the ability to share their favorites on social media. Due to limited computing power at the time, we used a simple algorithm to generate combinations instead of loading individual car images. The experience was built using Flash and FIVe3D since WebGL was not yet available until 2013.

What if someone told you that he would like to visualize 850 variants of a car in a shared space?

Better doing it in a web application.

Audi wanted to show that the new "A1" was totally customizable and there was one waiting for you.

With that in mind, we created a web experience that was displaying all the Audi A1 models that a user could buy in a store. Giving the change to share their favorite option in the social media.

Technically speaking, the challenge was to load all that stuff. Because 8 years ago the computers wasn't powerful as today. Instead of loading 850 different car images we composed all the possible combinations with a simple algorithm.

Since WebGL was not available until 2013 the experience was built in Flash and FIVe3D.
